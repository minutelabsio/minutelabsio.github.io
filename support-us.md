# We exist because of our supporters

MinuteLabs.io is funded by people like you. We rely on our Patreon patrons in order to
continue making Labs.

You can follow us and (optionally) give us money on [Patreon][1]. Even the smallest
donation will help a lot. Supporters also get the opportunity to see our Labs before
anyone else, and help us beta-test!

Another way to help us out is to share our labs on social media, and show them
to your friends, students, teachers... basically everyone.

Thanks for your help!
