*Understandable masses and energies and how they relate*

A scale of common, and not-so-common masses and energies to give you a sense for just how much energy is stored as mass. (maybe more than you think!)

Best viewed on desktop browsers (because there's so much stuff). Should work on tablets but might be a bit sluggish.
