*See the Equivalence Principle in action!*

We've sent the MinutePhysics sheep into space to investigate the effects of non-inertial reference frames! In our case, that's a fancy way of saying: “accelerating rocket”. You'll be able to see the Equivalence Principle in action. The Space Sheep will feel like they are under the effects of a gravitational field when the rocket is accelerating.
