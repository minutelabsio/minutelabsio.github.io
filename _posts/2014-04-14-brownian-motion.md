*Play with the majestic motion of Brownian particles*

An interactive physics simulation of Brownian Motion! Brownian Motion is the random motion of particles that are suspended in a gas or a liquid. Drag the first slider to see what's going on behind the scenes and play around with the physical parameters. You can also download a snapshot if your particles draw you something inspiring.
