Henry came up with the idea for Map Race during the 2012 olympics when he was exploring the great cities of Europe with his friend Alex – from Alex's living room. They told Jasper about it, and over the next few months, Jasper worked sporadic nights and weekends to turn the idea into reality - until we were scooped by Geoguessr.com. Thanks, Geoguessr, (and xkcd) for giving us the kick in the pants we needed to finally release this little game to the public – we hope you all enjoy it!
